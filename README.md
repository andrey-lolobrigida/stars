Data Science project for learning purposes. It's about the 'Star dataset to predict star types', publicly available at the Kaggle plataform.

In the 'notebooks' folder, you'll find the two following files:

- stars: the main study notebook. It presents the EDA carried out about our dataset, and the model training for predicting our target variable (star type).
- mlf_tracking_stars: the showcase of a MLFlow process to log model experiments.
